gingerprawn
===========

This is **gingerprawn**, a modular pluggable framework for wxPython;
and **JNMaster**, a bunch of plugins written on top of gingerprawn, intended
to help students in Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China to make better use of
the school intranet.


Runtime dependencies
--------------------

``gingerprawn.api.webop`` depends on ``lxml`` and ``mechanize``. You can get
them like this:

    $ sudo easy_install -U --always-unzip mechanize
    $ sudo easy_install -U --always-unzip lxml

Of course, as a framework, ``gingerprawn`` requires wxPython. The version must
be *at least 2.8*, and *the Unicode version is needed*. You can get wxPython
at its official website <http://www.wxpython.org/>.


Notes on development
--------------------

For development you would want to use eric4 as the IDE or just stick to Vim
or Emacs or whatever editor you use.

Development is at a very early stage, and the codebase is not promised to
keep stable at the moment. If you feel like to contribute, contact the author:
